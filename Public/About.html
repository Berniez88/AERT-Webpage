        <h2>Our Team</h2>

        <p>
            The Atmospheric Electricity Research & Training (AERT) group at the 
            University of Maryland employs tools developed by the science community 
            to maximize the value of AE observations to society.  A priority 
            activity is the design and implementation of training material/programs 
            to educate weather forecasters across the Americas on the use of 
            space/ground-based lightning observations.  Advancement of techniques 
            to monitor the quality of data from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper 
            (GLM) are ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group manages the Mid-Atlantic Lightning Mapping Array (MALMA), a 
            state-of-the-art VHF network used for research and operational product 
            generation/validation.  Explorative research is being conducted on the 
            topics of multi-sensor data fusion, use of machine learning for 
            enhanced data quality, data assimilation, and virtual reality data 
            visualization.  Resources provided by the Proving Ground and Training 
            Center (PGTC) at the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System 
            Studies (CISESS) College Park facility enable synergy of AERT activities 
            with broad atmospheric science research-to-operations activities in 
            coordination with NOAA/NESDIS, NASA, and private vendors.
